# CrackStation

This crack station package can crack one and two digit alpha-numeric passwords.
The function is passed in with a SHA1 hash and the equivalent alpha-numeric password will be returned.

The hash dictionary file in the repository contains the hashes for all two digit combinations from which the package will lookup and find the correct match.

Happy cracking!!
